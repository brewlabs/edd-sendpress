Integrate the Easy Digital Downloads plugin easily with the SendPress to collect emails on checkout.

== Description ==

This extension integrates your Easy Digital Downloads store with SendPress allowing customers to opt themselves into the list during checkout.

The plugin will place a simple checkbox on the checkout page that customers can use to opt-in into your newsletter. This is a proven way to dramatically grow your subscription lists.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `edd-sendpress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory -- or just upload the ZIP package via 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' in your WP Admin
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go, manage and display your digital downloads even more easily :)

**Requirements:** In order for this plugin to activate & work you also must have *SendPress: Email Marketing and Newsletters* as well as the *Easy Digital Downloads* plugin installed. Otherwise *SendPress for Easy Digital Downloads* will be useless for you!
